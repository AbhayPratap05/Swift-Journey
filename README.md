# Swift Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey learning the Swift programming language.  
It includes code snippets, examples, and notes to help me (and others) understand Swift fundamentals.

## 📚 Reference
All learning and code examples are based on the official Swift documentation:  
🔗 [https://docs.swift.org](https://docs.swift.org)

I'll keep adding more references and topics as I progress on this path.

## 📁 Contents
- `Swift_Basics_Notes.swift` – Notes with explanations and examples on:
  - Constants & Variables
  - Optionals
  - Tuples
  - Type Safety & Inference
  - Assertions, and more

## 🧠 Goal
To build a strong understanding of Swift and document key milestones while making cool iOS/macOS projects along the way.
